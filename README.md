FMF Football iOS App
-------------------

To run:

1. You must have the most recent version of Xcode and the command line developer tools installed.  You will need an apple developer account for this.
2. Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) (a dependency manager for Objective-C projects, like bundler)
3. Install [the Facebook iOS SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/) (use the installer and not the github repo, this installs it to a standard location on your Mac)
3. cd into the directory containing this readme
4. Run `pod install` inside this directory
5. Install [Crashlytics](https://api.crashlytics.com/downloads/xcode)
6. Open the workspace file and run it for the simulator (or for device if you know what yer doin')
